# jkDownloader
A web browser bookmarklet making inconvenient or impossible downloads possible with as little as one click. Works on desktop browsers, mobile browsers, and even Microsoft Edge. Just add jkDownloader to your bookmarks (or Reading List in Edge) and trigger it on a supported webpage. As long as you're connected to the Internet, magic will happen.

I created jkDownloader because music download gates suck and harm both artists and fans. jkDownloader gives you the power to support artists in ways that *you* choose, as well as to download things that might not be available any other way. That being said, **please use jkDownloader responsibly**.

## Supported Websites
* **Artist Intelligence:** Forces email verification on a track instead of using SoundCloud login. The email address doesn't have to be valid.
* **Beatport Play Remixes:** Download a remix from its individual page.
* **Beatport Play Stems:** Download stems from the remix contest page.
* **EDMT:** Download a track without logging in with SoundCloud.
* **Hive:** Download tracks without even needing a Facebook account.
* **Mediafire:** Download without triggering ads.
* **SoundCloud:** Download music from track pages. The track download URL is used if available; otherwise the streaming URL is used.
* **SoundCloud Art:** Expand a track's art and activate jkDownloader, and the art will be downloaded instead. This is currently not possible on mobile browsers due to SoundCloud's mobile website. Any suggestions for incorporating an alternate way to trigger an art download in jkDownloader is appreciated.
* **Spinnin' Premium:** jkDownloader attempts to find the file on Spinnin Records' Amazon hosting.
* **Spinnin' Talent Pool:** Download tracks via a browser hijack I'm a little proud of.
* **Wavo Stems:** Download stems directly, sometimes even after a remix contest has ended. Sound familiar? The code was based off [wavo-parser](https://github.com/jkmartindale/wavo-parser).
* **Zippyshare:** Download without triggering ads.

##Unsupported Websites
